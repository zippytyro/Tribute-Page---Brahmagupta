            <li>Who was Brahmagupta?</li>
            <p>
              Brahmagupta was an Indian mathematician, born in 598 AD in
              Bhinmal, a state of Rajhastan, India. He spent most of his life in
              Bhinmal which was under the rule of King Vyaghramukha. He was the
              head of the astronomical observatory at Ujjain which was the
              center of mathematics in India witnessing the work of many
              extraordinary mathematicians.
            </p>
            <li>Contributions to Mathematics</li>
            <p>
              One of the most significant input of Brahmagupta to mathematics
              was the introduction of ‘zero’ to the number system which stood
              for ‘nothing’. His work the ‘Brahmasphutasiddhanta’ contained many
              mathematical findings written in verse form. It had many rules of
              arithmetic which is part of the mathematical solutions now. These
              are ‘A positive number multiplied by a positive number is
              positive.’, ‘A positive number multiplied by a negative number is
              negative’, ‘A negative number multiplied by a positive number is
              negative’ and ‘A negative number multiplied by a negative number
              is positive’. The book also consisted of many geometrical theories
              like the ‘Pythagorean Theorem’ for a right angle triangle.
              Brahmagupta was the one to give the area of a triangle and the
              important rules of trigonometry such as values of the sin
              function. He introduced the formula for cyclic quadrilaterals. He
              also gave the value of ‘Pi’ as square root ten to be accurate and
              3 as the practical value. Additionally he introduced the concept
              of negative numbers.

            <li>Contribution to Science & Astronomy</li>
            <p>
              Brahmagupta argued that the Earth and the universe are round and
              not flat. He was the first to use mathematics to predict the
              positions of the planets, the timings of the lunar and solar
              eclipses. Though all this seems like obvious and simple solutions
              it was a major improvement in science at that time. He also
              calculated the length of the solar year which was 365 days, 5
              minutes and 19 seconds which is quite accurate based on today’s
              calculation of 365 days, 5 hours and 19 seconds. He also talked
              about ‘gravity’ in one of his statements saying: ‘Bodies fall
              towards the earth as it is in the nature of the earth to attract
              bodies, just as it is in the nature of water to flow’.

            <li>Why is Zero important?</li>
            <p>
              Although it may seem obvious to us now that zero is a number, and
              obvious that we can produce it by subtracting a number from
              itself, and that dividing zero by a non-zero number gives an
              answer of zero, these results are not actually obvious. The
              brilliant mathematicians of Ancient Greece, so far ahead of their
              time in many ways, had not been able to make this breakthrough.
              Neither had anyone else, until Brahmagupta came along! It was a
              huge conceptual leap to see that zero is a number in its own
              right. Once this leap had been made, mathematics and science could
              make progress that would otherwise have been impossible.

            <li>Death</li>
            <p>
              This great mathematician died between 660 and 670. He was one of
              the greatest mathematicians in Indian history and his
              contributions to mathematics and science have made major
              differences to various mathematical problems by establishing the
              basic rules which now allow us to find their solutions. He was
              honored by the title given to him by a fellow scientist ‘Ganita
              Chakra Chudamani’ which is translated as ‘The gem of the circle of
              mathematicians’.
